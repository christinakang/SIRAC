# SIRAC
SIRAC :  semi-structured IRAC(Issue, Rule, Analysis and Conclusion) corpus for legal scenarios


As a result, we obtain the following novel findings via extensive analysis conducted by the law students:
- Without IRAC analysis from legal professionals, \chatGPT is able to obtain correct answers from 51.8\% of the scenarios.
-The accuracy of \chatGPT is improved by 0.79 in F1 score, when the rule and the application parts of human IRAC analysis were included.
- \chatGPT benefits from adding similar example scenarios with IRAC analysis during in-context learning, only if similar scenarios can be found.
- Decomposing legal questions into simpler ones consistently improve the accuracy of identifying legal concepts, such as "invitation to treat". However, this approach does not always improve the correctness of legal reasoning.
