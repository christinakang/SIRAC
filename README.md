SIRAC :  semi-structured IRAC(Issue, Rule, Application and Conclusion) corpus for legal scenarios

This repository contains the code for the SIRAC ï¼š semi-structured IRAC(Issue, Rule, Application and Conclusion) corpus for legal scenarios. The project is associated paper "Can ChatGPT Perform Reasoning Using the IRAC Method in Analyzing Legal Scenarios Like a Lawyer?". The data orpus conssiting of scenarios pertain to Contract Acts Malaysia and Australian Social Act for Dependent Child. 

IRAC (Issue, Rule, Application and Conclusion) is framework widely used by legal professionals for organizing legal analysis. Each scenarios in the corpus is annotated with a complete IRAC analysis in a semi-structred format so that both machines and legal professionals are albe to interpret and nderstand the annotations. 


In addition, we conduct the first empirical assessment of ChatGPT for IRAC analysis in order to understand how well they align with the analysis of legal professionals. Our experimental results shed lights on possible future research directions to improve alignments between LLMs and legal experts in terms of legal reasoning. 


## Quickstart

1. Install the package from github.

``` python
   pip install git+https://github.com/christinakang/SIRAC.git
```

2. Load the scenario

Cate saw the advertisement. She telephoned Alan, saying that she would buy the book for $1000. Alan, however, replied that he had reconsidered the matter and that he could not sell the book for less than $2000.Cate replied that she would give him $1500. Alan replied that he would only sell the book for $2000 but that he would keep his offer open for seven days.He also said that Cate could fax her acceptance to him if she wanted.The next day Alan sold the book to his friend David because David loved the book so much and because he paid $7000 for it. Two days later Cate decided to purchase the book for Alan's price of $2000.She posted her acceptance to Alan.The next day David told Cate that he had bought a copy of Kidnapped from Alan for $7, 000.
